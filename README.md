# utils_jgm
general python utilities

## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/jgmakin/utils_jgm.git
```

## Setup:
Edit the configuration file. There is a template in `utils_jgm/util_config.json`.  You can edit this one or place a new one (which has priority) in `~/.config/master_jgm.json`. You won't need to fill out all the directories unless you require every last method in the package, so you can probably fake most of them.
